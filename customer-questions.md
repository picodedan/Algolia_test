# Question 1: 

Hello,
I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:

Records
Indexing
I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."

Cheers, George

## Answer 1:

Hello George, 

Happy to help clarrify these terms!  

Records are an individual entry of your data.  Something like an individual product and all the relevant data that is part of that product.  A good example might be a record for a digital camera,  the record could include the model name,  brand, price,  stock or item #, and possibly other information like the customer rating for that product, it's popularity score, and similar information. 

Indexing at a high level is how we store and organize your data for efficient retrival and searching!  Generally we start with collecting a set of datapoints(records as above) and define indexes for certain fields in that data.  The index makes it MUCH faster to find groups of data later.  For example using the camera record from earlier,  we might index on price, so that we can quickly sort a set of results by price.  

For Custom Ranking, that will be a bit more specific to your company's data and objectives.  Let's setup a call to dive into that more specifically for you so I can get a bit more context on your data and objectives and make some reccomendations based on that!  

# Question 2: 
Hello,
Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.
Regards, Matt

## Answer 2:

Hello Matt, 

I always love hearing feedback from my customers! Yes, even the negative!  If you have some time I'd love to setup a quick call with you to walk though your workflow while you are iterating. This will give me some extra context and better understanding of your experience which I can take back to my team to see what we can do to make that better for you.  

# Question 3:

Hi,
I'm looking to integrate Algolia in my website. Will this be a lot of development work for me? What's the high level process look like?
Regards, Leo


## Answer 3:

Hello Leo, 

Thanks for reaching out!  There definitely will be some integration and development work to leverage all the great capabilities of Algolia.  That being said,  with our available libraries you should find quite a lot of ready made and easy to integrate components and tools for whatever application stack you are on.  You can find the libraries [here](https://community.algolia.com/).  

At a high level,  we would start with taking a look at the data you have now, and how that would get uploaded into Algolia. Then do some configuration of your indicies in Algolia to make sure your users can search on the terms you want.  Following that would be integrating the search API into your website!  A more detailed rundown can be found [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/implementation-process/).  Feel free to take a look!  

I hope that helped you understand the process a bit better,  please feel free to reach out with any further questions or concerns. Happy to help.
